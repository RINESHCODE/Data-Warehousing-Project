Got it ✅
Since I know your project has **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers** with stored procedures, transformations, and business-friendly models, I’ll draft a professional **README.md** for your GitHub repository.

Here’s a polished version 👇

# 🏗️ Data Warehouse Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Data Warehouse Implementation** built using **SQL Server**.
It follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to ensure clean, reliable, and business-ready data for analytics and reporting.

The repository contains scripts for:

* **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingestion from multiple sources (CRM, ERP).
* **Silver Layer** → Data cleaning, transformations, and business logic.
* **Gold Layer** → Final dimension and fact tables for business reporting.

## 🪙 Bronze Layer

* Ingests raw CSV data from CRM and ERP systems.
* Uses `BULK INSERT` for efficient data loading.
* Captures **batch\_start\_date** and **batch\_end\_date** for auditing.
* Implements **TRY...CATCH** with detailed logging.

📌 Example:

```sql
PRINT '>> Truncating Table : bronze.crm_cust_info';
TRUNCATE TABLE bronze.crm_cust_info;

PRINT '>> Inserting data into : bronze.crm_cust_info';
BULK INSERT bronze.crm_cust_info
FROM 'datasets/source_crm/cust_info.csv'
WITH (FIRSTROW = 2, FIELDTERMINATOR = ',', TABLOCK);
```

## ⚙️ Silver Layer

* Cleans and standardizes raw data.
* Handles **nulls, invalid dates, gender standardization, marital status mapping**.
* Applies **ROW\_NUMBER()** for deduplication.
* Ensures referential integrity between CRM & ERP datasets.

📌 Key Features:

* `crm_cust_info` → Deduplicated customers with enriched attributes.
* `crm_prd_info` → Product details with start/end dates.
* `crm_sales_details` → Validated sales records with corrected amounts.
* ERP tables cleaned for **country codes, gender, and IDs**.

---

## 📊 Gold Layer

* Provides **business-friendly views** for analytics.
* Follows **Star Schema** design:

  * `dim_customers`
  * `dim_products`
  * `fact_sales`

📌 Highlights:

* Surrogate keys (`ROW_NUMBER()`) for dimensions.
* Fact table joins dimensions via natural/business keys.
* Only **current data** is retained (historical data filtered out).

Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW gold.fact_sales AS
SELECT 
   sd.sls_ord_num AS order_number,
   pr.product_key,
   cu.customer_key,
   sd.sls_order_dt AS order_date,
   sd.sls_sales AS sales_amount
FROM silver.crm_sales_details sd
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products pr
  ON sd.sls_prd_key = pr.product_number
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers cu
  ON sd.sls_cust_id = cu.customer_id;
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-warehouse-project.git
   ```
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
3. Execute scripts in the following order:

   * `bronze_load.sql` → Load raw data.
   * `silver_load.sql` → Clean and transform data.
   * `gold_views.sql` → Create reporting views.

⚡ Pro Tip: Add **ER diagrams, architecture diagram, or sample query screenshots** in a `docs/` folder to make your GitHub repo even more impressive.

Do you want me to also **design an ER diagram / architecture diagram** for your README (I can generate it as an image) so your repo looks more professional?
